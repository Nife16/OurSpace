Git Commands!!!

To start:
1) Create your git repo online on github.com

2) After your repo has been created, Copy the url in the long blue box

3) If your project already exists on your computer, run git init to init,
then run git remote add origin (the url copies from github)
this will link your local repo to the online github repo

4) Then run:
git commit -m "first commit"  (This will be your first commit to push to your github repo)

git push -u origin master (This will actually push your code up to github)
